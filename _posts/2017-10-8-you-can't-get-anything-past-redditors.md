## People forget that Reddit has paid ads, and they kinda work

A post titled 'These 13 House Reps sponsored a bill to legalize mass surveillance on Americans and called it the USA Liberty Act' made it's way to the front page.

The top comment was:

> This is an ad for a VPN Service and the OP of this thread is the author of the article, Caleb Chen.

> Scroll to the bottom of the article to "About Caleb Chen" he happens to use the exact same wording as OP's username.

The post isn't worth linking to as then one might be temped to actually visit said article, and that wouldn't be good.

## Everything wont actually melt down

As usual, a Redditor steps in to clear things up:

*****

>Power networks are resistant to flares because they generally have quite low impedances.

>Communications lines are far more vulnerable, but for a line to be badly hit it must be both long and made of copper. Generally our most important links are either made of fiber (for all the high speed intercontinental stuff), or short (for the cables between equipment in the same room).

>The importance of satellites has dropped in recent years because they can't get low latency connections used for internet links. Less accurate weather prediction, loss of satellite TV, and holes in gps service are the only probable outfall.

>Only home users with cable/adsl would be hit, and even then a simple replacement of the modem on each end of the cable would probably get it all up and running again. Phone lines are typically twisted, and cable typically coaxial, both of which provide some amount of solar flare resistance.

>I would argue that the paper might have been accurate in 1995, but now a significant proportion of critical infrastructure would survive a serious solar flare.

>Remember the last solar flare it was mostly telegraph equipment that failed. Thats because the telegraph cables were tens of miles long, untwisted and unshielded. They probably also didn't have any kind of isolation at the ends of the cables. Modern equipment has all this sort of protections to protect against lightning hits, so should be fine.

>Bear in mind that while the equipment will not be damaged, it may stop working during the solar storm. After the storm you'll have to give it a reboot to clear any protective circuitry and get it up and running again.

He reposts his comment from 4 years ago when this was brought up last. It's a super interesting read. He basically outlines that things will be fucked, but not to the point that 'everything will melt down'.

It wont be Mad Max, but humans will find an excise to riot.

## Woman goes on date, guy smokes meth, she proceeds to nope the fuck out

isterbibble on Reddit:

>While on an unremarkable first date, the guy asked if I minded if he smoked and I said no. We were walking in a quiet park after dinner. He sits down on a bench and busts out meth, asking me if I want some. After realizing he intend to smoke meth, not cigarettes or weed, I said it was time for me to go home. He seemed surprised and then said, “it’s because of the meth, isn’t it?”

Not sure what this dude was thinking, at least wait until the *third* date to bust out the glass dick.

What a loser.

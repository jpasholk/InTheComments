A Redditor posts a tip about getting your baby’s car seat inspected by a firefighter after getting into an accident. They claimed that the firefighters would give you a voucher of some sort for your insurance company to replace it.

At first, this doesn’t sound too weird. After thinking about it for a second, you realize that it is a needless extra step. You should be able to file for it like anything else.

## A Firefighter steps in to drop some knowledge

The [top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/74ksii/lpt_if_you_were_in_an_accident_and_had_a_car_seat/dnzd7xy/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=LifeProTips) is a firefighter who tears the LPT to shreds:

> There are many departments who do not offer car seat inspections, mine included. It's a liability for us. Why it's that way, I don't know, but we won't inspect or install car seats. We are not trained to do so. We can simply recommend following the manufacturers recommendations, which in most cases are that if a car seat is involved in a motor vehicle accident, it should be replaced with a new car seat immediately.

If your insurance company needs a voucher from the FIRE DEPARTMENT to replace your BABY’S car seat after a CAR ACCIDENT, then you need a NEW INSURANCE COMPANY.

A Redditor posts a tip about getting your baby’s car seat inspected by a firefighter after getting into an accident. They claimed that the firefighters would give you a voucher of some sort for your insurance company to replace it.

At first, this doesn’t sound too weird. After thinking about it for a second, you realize that it is a needless extra step. You should be able to file for it like anything else.

## A Firefighter steps in to drop some knowledge

The top comment is a firefighter who tears the LPT to shreds:

If it&#x27;s unsafe, they can give you a slip for your insurance company to replace it.</a>.</div><script async src="https://www.redditstatic.com/comment-embed.js"></script>

If your insurance company needs a voucher from the FIRE DEPARTMENT to replace your BABY’S car seat after a CAR ACCIDENT, then you need a NEW INSURANCE COMPANY.

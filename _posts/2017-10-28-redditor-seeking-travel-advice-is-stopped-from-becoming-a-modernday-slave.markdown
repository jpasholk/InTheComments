## An innocent question posted on Reddit saved him from modern-day slavery

The guy really just asked for some advice about going to the Netherlands. He's very lucky that he thought to ask Reddit. The Netherlands based company has done this before, and probably will again.

Someone with the proper knowledge and resources needs to take action against them.

In this day and age it doesn't seem like slavery is something you'd have to worry about. One would think that with all of the advances in technology and social services, slavery wouldn't really be able to exist.

However, if you are hard up for a job, be careful of offers that seem too good to be true. Especially if they don't even interview you, this should be a huge red flag.

Remember, there are no such thing as one way roads in the job market.

Sometimes being a decent human being just means sitting down with someone, talking and then actually listening to them. It literally doesn't cost you anything, and could save someone's live.

You don't have to be a celebrity either, we all can do this. It's not a superpower, it's an essential part of the human experience.

Next time you see someone looking down, think about speaking up.

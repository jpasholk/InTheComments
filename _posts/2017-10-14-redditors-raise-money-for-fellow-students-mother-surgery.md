## Girl posts in the Romanian subreddit asking for help, everyone pulls together

This is a great example of how Reddit transcends the internet and connects us all together. Reddit has it's own shortcomings and nuances, but it is examples like this that reinforce my faith in the Reddit and broader internet communities in general. It may seem like negativity rules, but there are a lot of silent 'angels' that go unnoticed.

We are all better because of acts like this.

## Thank you video from the girl herself

Faith in humanity restored. (At least for a bit.)

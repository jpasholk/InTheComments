## DIY Marking knife made from a drill bit

This guy knows how to make an Imgur album. The gifs that show the build process are a nice touch. Instead of scrolling through an album with 40+ pictures, it's condensed into 8 instead.

The homemade anvil from an I-beam is also equally impressive. This guys dad seems even more rad than he is. Who makes an anvil out of an I-beam?

A fucking boss, thats who.

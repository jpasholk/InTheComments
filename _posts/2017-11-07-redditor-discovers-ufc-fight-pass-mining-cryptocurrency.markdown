## Redditor 'gambledub' outlines the entire thing beautifully

YSK UFC Fight Pass is using your PC to crypto mine. Your CPU is being used to mine, without your knowledge on a service you already pay for!</a>.</div><script async src="https://www.redditstatic.com/comment-embed.js"></script>

> Thirdly, this is a service that WE ALREADY PAY FOR! This is one of the big issues people are overlooking. If they want to mine currency of your computer instead of using advertisments or subscriptions that is one thing. But if you are already paying for a Fight Pass subscription, you SHOULD NOT be paying extra to make someone else money. Even if it cost you 0.000001 cent, it is the principle.

This is the real issue here. It wouldn't be as bad if this was a free service. People would be able to claim, 'well, it's free so x, y, and z... They were exploiting users that had **already** paid. Inexcusable.

Wtf UFC, we thought you were cool...

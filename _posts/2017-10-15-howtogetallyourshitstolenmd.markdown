## Sometimes, common sense is lost on people

When you are traveling you pretty much always want to bring your most valuable items in the room with you. Leaving everything in your car probably isn't the smartest thing. It's a common place for thieves to steal from, especially if you're trying to save a buck when traveling.

Generally it's the nicer places that have less crime, but thats not always true. I've personally stayed in dozens of Motel 6's and haven't had any issues with theft. But if you're worried about someone stealing from you in the middle of the night, pay a little extra for the hotel room and you'll sleep a little easier.

In another post in the Life Pro Tips sub on Reddit, someone advises getting auto loans from credit unions or banks instead of the car dealership. While this isn’t necessarily a bad recommendation, you’re able to get a much better deal if you have an approved loan in hand when walking into the dealership.

Also, a lot of dealerships will offer zero percent interest when purchasing a new car.

## Come with a loan, but be open to a better deal

One guy says to come with a loan, but let the dealer get a better one if possible:

Another guy flat out says that this is bad advise and dealerships can ‘almost always’ give you the best rate:

<div class="reddit-embed" data-embed-media="www.redditmedia.com" data-embed-parent="false" data-embed-live="false" data-embed-uuid="5c124ca1-62b1-458f-8e98-a564f29c1e59" data-embed-created="2017-10-14T14:56:06.561Z"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/74u61l/lpt_get_your_auto_loans_from_credit_unions_or/do1a1ua/">Comment</a> from discussion <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/74u61l/lpt_get_your_auto_loans_from_credit_unions_or/">LPT: Get your auto loans from credit unions or banks.

It seems that this might be a good recommendation for buying a used car, but most likely not for a new one. Your best bet is not to expect someone to give you a deal.

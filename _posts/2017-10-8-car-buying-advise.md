In another post in the Life Pro Tips sub on Reddit, someone advises getting auto loans from credit unions or banks instead of the car dealership. While this isn’t necessarily a bad recommendation, you’re able to get a much better deal if you have an approved loan in hand when walking into the dealership.

Also, a lot of dealerships will offer zero percent interest when purchasing a new car.

## Come with a loan, but be open to a better deal

[One guy says](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/74u61l/lpt_get_your_auto_loans_from_credit_unions_or/do148ca/) to come with a loan, but let the dealer get a better one if possible:

> Come with a loan already approved but still let the dealer arrange a loan for you. Sometimes the dealer can get you a better rate than your own bank/union.

Another guy [flat out says](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/74u61l/lpt_get_your_auto_loans_from_credit_unions_or/do1a1ua/) that this is bad advise and dealerships can ‘almost always’ give you the best rate:

> Bad advice. Dealerships can almost always beat your rate. It’s good to come with one in hand though.
What about new cars? Are you going to refuse 0%?

It seems that this might be a good recommendation for buying a used car, but most likely not for a new one. Your best bet is not to expect someone to give you a deal.

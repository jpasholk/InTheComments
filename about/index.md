## Wtf is this?

This is a nothing more than a side project that sprouted out of an idea I had a while ago. The name stems from the meme ‘The real LPT is always in the comments’ from Reddit. A lot of times you’ll stumble on to something that is much more interesting or funny than what led you there.

I can't remember how many times I've found myself several levels down a comment chain and found gold. This blog will mostly serve as a dumping place for those nuggets, for fun.

I am not sure if/ when I'll implement ads. So far I'm keeping the costs down with this site so I don't really care about making anything from it. If it grows in popularity I may consider tiny ad placement in the footer.


## Is it really just shit from Reddit?

Yes and no.

Reddit is admittedly an amazing source of content. Whether it’s from other sources reposted there or the actual comments themselves; the content is great if you know what you’re looking for.

That doesn’t mean Reddit will be the only source, it’s just what inspired my idea for this site.

## Before you go

If you like the idea for this site, and would like to contribute, or recommend more sources please feel free to reach out to me. I am always looking for new and fun people to work with.
